This codes are developing for Automated Generation of Many-Body Coupled Cluster Diagrams
•	Developed a streamlined algorithm for generating contracted many-body coupled cluster diagrams.
•	Focus on enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of electron-correlation calculations in atoms and molecules.
•	New Algorithm Features:
-	 Integer Representation of Goldstone Diagrams.
-	 Contraction of Diagrams in their integer forms.
-	 Rejection of Duplicate Diagrams.
-	 General evaluation of phase factors diagrams.
-	 Developed a TensorFlow-based Deep learning model to convert user-drawn operator  
 diagrams into a set of integers and convert the contracted integers into the diagram. 
-	 Developing software containing a GUI canvas and buttons through which users can  
 provide the input operators and get the contracted diagrams as well as the corresponding  
 phase values.
